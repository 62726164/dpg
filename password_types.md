Types of Passwords

Understanding basic password types will help you devise a strong password management strategy for all of your accounts. In general and at a high-level, there are two basic types of passwords:

  1. Primary Passwords
  2. Secondary Passwords

Primary passwords are inputted physically into a device. For example, logging into the operating system of a laptop in front of you or a tablet you are holding. Primary passwords are not good candidates for password managers. You should commit them to memory, or write them down and store them in your wallet or purse, or carry a [password card](https://www.passwordcard.org/en) to manage them. 

Secondary passwords are logically or remotely inputted into a device. Entering a password into a bank's website or remotely logging into a system are examples of secondary passwords. Secondary passwords are ideal candidates for password managers and can be used at your bank, social media sites, etc.

DPG is intended to generate and manage secondary passwords.
