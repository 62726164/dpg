## Types of Passwords

Understanding basic password types will help you devise a strong password management strategy for all of your accounts. In general and at a high-level, there are two basic types of passwords:

```bash
  1. Primary Passwords
  2. Secondary Passwords
```

Primary passwords are inputted physically into a device. For example, logging into the operating system of a laptop, tablet, or smart phone. Primary passwords are not good candidates for password managers. You must commit them to memory, or [write them down](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/06/write_down_your.html) and store them in your wallet or purse, or carry a [password card](https://github.com/62726164/ppcard). [NIST 800-63-3b](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) refers to primary passwords as 'Memorized Secrets'.

Secondary passwords can be logically or remotely inputted into systems. They do not have to be memorized. Entering a password into a bank's website or sshing into a remote system are a few examples. Secondary passwords are ideal candidates for password managers.

DPG is intended to generate and manage secondary passwords.
